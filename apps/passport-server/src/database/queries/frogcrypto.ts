/**
 * Update the last time a user has polled a feed.
 *
 * The primary invariant of this query is that the user state is updated
 * atomically:
 * - Last fetched timestamp is updated if and only if user is eligible to fetch
 *   a frog and ended up issued a frog.
 * - Any concurrent requests must process in sequence and will not deadlock.
 *
 * This query should be used in a transaction where the server can perform
 * additional logic or queries based on the user state returned by this query.
 * Ther server should only COMMIT the transaction at the end of these
 * operations. This ensures that the user state update is automatically rolled
 * back in case of error.
 *
 * This query uses `SELECT FOR UPDATE NOWAIT` to acquire a lock on the row. If
 * the row is already locked by another transaction, this query will throw an
 * error. This ensures any concurrent transactions will not deadlock on this row
 * or read and exploit stale data.
 *
 * - If `NOWAIT` is not specified, a second query could wait for the lock to be
 *   released until timeout. This doesn't hurt correctness but due to the
 *   cooldown mechanics, it is unlikely that the second query will be able to
 *   fetch a frog.
 * - If `SELECT FOR UPDATE` is not specified, the row will only be locked when
 *   transactions are committed in sequence. As is, the query will return stale
 *   data and makes the concurent request eligible for double issuance. Instead,
 *   we would have to codify "compare and set" logic in the query, which is more
 *   error prone and complicated. We need to first fetch the old value, then
 *   update the row only if the old value still matches the expected value. This
 *   requires two queries and additional logic in the case of bail.
 *
 * Note the seemingly complicated situation is due to:
 * - Our issuing logic requires use of Transaction for easy rollback.
 * - Our cooldown logic requires atomic update where row-level locks is one of
 *   the easiest and more robust solutions.
 *
 * @returns the old last_fetched_at value or undefined if the row was not found.
