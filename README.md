# Instructions

In the root of this project, execute the following to start the server and the static site locally.

```bash
yarn # installs dependencies
yarn dev
```

# Deployment

- The static site is deployed to https://pcd-passport.com/
- The server is deployed to https://api.pcd-passport.com/

For both, build configuration is specified on render.com. This means that if build scripts change, those changes must be reflected in render.com's configurations for the changed application.
