// All of these modules being separated by type allows them to expose a common
// structure which makes for readable patterns in code.  Re-exporting them all
// here with custom names allows an IDE to auto-import these symbols as
// necessary, which doesn't work if every use site has to use an `import * as`
// directive directly.
