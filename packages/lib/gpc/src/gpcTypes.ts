 * - Binding fills in the circuit identifier in the config and validates

 * - Canonicalizing eliminates optional fields containing default values,
 *   eliminates any unknown fields, and also ensures that object and entry names
 *   iterate in sorted order.  This ensures that two configs which behave the
 *   same are also deep equal for easy comparison.
 *
 * Note that these steps cannot verify anything about future inputs.  In

 * not be sufficient for all inputs.  If you need a larger size, you can pick
